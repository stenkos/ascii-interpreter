# ascii-interpreter
This is a simple python script that turns inputted binary code into a string character using ASCII. The script itself runs in the console and takes no arguments in the shell.
## Installation & usage
Download the repo as a ZIP, or run `git clone https://github.com/stenkos/ascii-interpreter.git`. Alternatively, an executable can be obtained in the 'Releases' tab. The script can then be run on its own using python (`python main.py`) or through the executable in a shell (`ascii-interpreter`).
## Changelog (v2)
- added delete function
- fixed wording
